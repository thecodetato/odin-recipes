      The benefits of salmon is that it is packed with omega-3 fatty acids.
      Omega-3 fatty acids offer a range of nutrition benefits, including
      lowering risk factors for heart disease, fighting inflammation, assisting
      with prevention of auto-immune diseases, and improving eye health. Next,
      salmon are high in protein as well.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ounces cooked salmon, flaked</li>
      <li>1 cup cooked white rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon sriracha or other hot sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Japanese mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 sheet nori, torn</li>
      <li>½ ripe avocado, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ cup kimchi</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use a fork to flake salmon onto a microwave-safe plate. Top with rice
        and place 1 ice cube on top. Cover with a microwave-safe lid and
        microwave at low power for 30 seconds. Uncover and check temperature. If
        salmon and rice are not warm enough, cover and return to the microwave
        for another 30 seconds at low power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover and remove ice cube. Drizzle soy sauce, Sriracha and mayonnaise
        over the top and toss everything with a fork until well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with torn pieces of nori, sliced avocado and kimchi.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
    <p>
      You can use any type of mayonnaise in this recipe and any type of rice,
      even brown or short grain Japanese sushi rice.
    </p>
    <p>Save time by purchasing pre-cooked salmon for this recipe.</p>
    <p>
      If you don't have a microwave, an oven will work too. Place salmon, rice
      and ice cube on a large piece of foil on a baking sheet and fold foil up
      around the sides to seal. Cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10
      minutes and proceed with the recipe as written.
