      spices. Each bite is a burst of flavors, with the tender chicken infused

    </p>
    <h4>How to make:</h4>
    <p>
      To make Chicken Biryani, partially cook seasoned chicken breasts in a
      large pan until browned. Set the chicken aside and cook garlic, onions,
      and ginger in the same pan to build the flavor base. Once the onions are
      translucent, add spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken, and cook
      thoroughly. Simmer covered for about 20 minutes to achieve a wow-worthy
      Chicken Biryani. Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon for added
      freshness and vibrancy.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup low-sodium teriyaki marinade</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili oil</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 bunch broccoli, cut into florets</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into 6 wedges</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black and white sesame seeds (optional)</li>
      <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour teriyaki marinade, horseradish, and chili oil into a resealable
        plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess
        air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat chicken in teriyaki marinade and cook on the prepared grill until
        no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile place broccoli florets and red pepper strips in a large bowl.
        Drizzle with sesame oil and toss to coat. Add garlic powder, black
        pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper and toss to coat again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place broccoli and red pepper strips in a grill basket and grill,
        turning occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill pineapple until soft and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice pineapple and chicken into 1-inch cubes. In 4 separate bowls layer
        rice, chicken, pineapple, broccoli, and red peppers. Garnish each bowl
        with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce
        over each bowl if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
