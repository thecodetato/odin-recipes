    <h4>Description:</h4>

    <p>
      Teriyaki, (Japanese: “glossy broil”) in Japanese cuisine, foods grilled
      with a highly flavoured glaze of soy sauce and sake or mirin (sweet wine).
      The word teriyaki is a compound that describes both the marinade and
      cooking technique: “teri” means gloss and “yaki” means to cook, fry, or
      grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garlic and fresh ginger are sometimes added to the mixture. In westernized
      Japanese cooking, the teriyaki sauce is frequently used as a marinade as
      well as a basting sauce.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup low-sodium teriyaki marinade</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili oil</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 bunch broccoli, cut into florets</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into 6 wedges</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black and white sesame seeds (optional)</li>
      <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour teriyaki marinade, horseradish, and chili oil into a resealable
        plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess
        air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat chicken in teriyaki marinade and cook on the prepared grill until
        no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile place broccoli florets and red pepper strips in a large bowl.
        Drizzle with sesame oil and toss to coat. Add garlic powder, black
        pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper and toss to coat again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place broccoli and red pepper strips in a grill basket and grill,
        turning occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill pineapple until soft and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice pineapple and chicken into 1-inch cubes. In 4 separate bowls layer
        rice, chicken, pineapple, broccoli, and red peppers. Garnish each bowl
        with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce
        over each bowl if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
