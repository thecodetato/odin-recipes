    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      Chicken Biryani is a tantalizing dish that brings together fragrant
      long-grain rice, succulent chicken pieces, and a symphony of aromatic
      spices. Each bite is a burst of flavors, with the tender chicken infused

    </p>
    <h4>How to make:</h4>
    <p>
      To make Chicken Biryani, partially cook seasoned chicken breasts in a
      large pan until browned. Set the chicken aside and cook garlic, onions,
      and ginger in the same pan to build the flavor base. Once the onions are
      translucent, add spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken, and cook
      thoroughly. Simmer covered for about 20 minutes to achieve a wow-worthy
      Chicken Biryani. Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon for added
      freshness and vibrancy.

      <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
      <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons biryani masala powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust according to your spice preference)
        1 teaspoon garam masala powder
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For garnish:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fried onions (you can buy them ready-made or fry thinly sliced onions
        until golden brown)
      </li>
      <li>Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee in a large pot or Dutch oven over
        medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown and
        caramelized. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for
        garnishing.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a
        minute until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they turn white and are
        no longer pink. Stir in the biryani masala powder, turmeric powder, red
        chili powder, and salt. Cook for 2-3 minutes to allow the spices to coat
        the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their
        juices. Then, add the plain yogurt and mix well. Cook for another 5
        minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors are well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the soaked basmati rice and add it to a separate pot with 4 cups
        of water. Bring to a boil and cook until the rice is 70% cooked. Drain
        the rice and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot or Dutch oven, layer half of the partially cooked rice.
        Sprinkle half of the garam masala powder, chopped cilantro, and mint
        leaves over the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the chicken masala mixture evenly over the rice layer. Top it
        with the remaining rice and sprinkle the remaining garam masala powder,
        chopped cilantro, and mint leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee over the rice and cover the pot
        with a tight-fitting lid. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes or
        until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes, covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before serving, garnish with the reserved fried onions and
        saffron-soaked milk. Gently mix the rice and chicken layers together,
        being careful not to break the rice grains.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.</li>
    </ol>
