    <p>
      Spaghetti Bolognese -- a classic Italian dish featuring al dente pasta
      tossed in a savory tomato-based sauce infused with minced meat, aromatic
      herbs, and a hint of garlic. The combination of tender meat, rich flavors,
      and the satisfying texture of the pasta creates a comforting and
      satisfying culinary experience that I find irresistible.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring
        and crumbling into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain
        excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and cook until fragrant, about 2
        minutes. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. Cook until beef
        absorbs some sauce, about 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.

        Plate to your desire, or serve over hot cooked rice; garnish with sesame
        seeds and remaining green onions.
