    <h4>Description:</h4>

    <p>
      This Korean beef bowl is seasoned with green onions, garlic, ginger, soy
      sauce, and sesame. Beef is an excellent source of iron. The iron in beef
      helps your body produce hemoglobin, a protein that helps your blood carry
      oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Raised free-range in the
      South Korean countryside, Hanwoo cattle are known for their high marbling,
      beefy flavor and slightly sweet taste – a result of an organic mixed grain
      and grass diet. In South Korea, locally bred Hanwoo is the meat of choice
      – and it's priced accordingly.

      The ingredients can easily be adjusted to suit your taste. The best side
      dishes to serve with Korean beef are fried rice, cilantro lime rice,
      quinoa salad, macaroni salad, Brussels sprouts, charro beans, broccoli,
      stuffed peppers, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash, spicy cucumber salad,
      kimchi fried rice, Korean green salad, bao buns, and radish salad.

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring
        and crumbling into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain
        excess grease.
      </li>

        Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and cook until fragrant, about 2
        minutes. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. Cook until beef
        absorbs some sauce, about 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.

        Plate to your desire, or serve over hot cooked rice; garnish with sesame
        seeds and remaining green onions.
