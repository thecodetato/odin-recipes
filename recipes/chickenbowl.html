    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      The first recipe, and a clear indication of my preference-- is the Chicken
      Teriyaki Rice Bowl recipe.

    <p>
      Teriyaki, (Japanese: “glossy broil”) in Japanese cuisine, foods grilled
      with a highly flavoured glaze of soy sauce and sake or mirin (sweet wine).
      Garlic and fresh ginger are sometimes added to the mixture. In westernized
      Japanese cooking, the teriyaki sauce is frequently used as a marinade as
      well as a basting sauce.
