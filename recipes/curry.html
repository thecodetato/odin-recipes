    </p>
<h4>How to make:</h4>
    <p>
      Start by partially cooking your seasoned chicken breasts in a large pan, removing them after they're browned. After setting the chicken breasts aside, cook garlic, onions, and ginger in the same pan to create the flavor base. Once the onions are translucent, add in spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken to cook thoroughly. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes for a wow-worthy chicken curry. Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use a fork to flake salmon onto a microwave-safe plate. Top with rice
        and place 1 ice cube on top. Cover with a microwave-safe lid and
        microwave at low power for 30 seconds. Uncover and check temperature. If
        salmon and rice are not warm enough, cover and return to the microwave
        for another 30 seconds at low power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover and remove ice cube. Drizzle soy sauce, Sriracha and mayonnaise
        over the top and toss everything with a fork until well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with torn pieces of nori, sliced avocado and kimchi.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
    <p>
      Allowing the curry to cook with the spices for a few minutes allows all the flavors to infuse into the chicken.</p>
    <p>Leftover chicken curry can be refrigerated in a sealed container and enjoyed for two to four days. Freezing extends the time to two months — simply thaw and gently reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.
